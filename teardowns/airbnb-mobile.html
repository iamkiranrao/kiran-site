      "title": "Meet Maya: The Experienced User Who's Losing Faith",
      "content": "Maya's a marketing director at a mid-sized tech company in Austin. She travels 4-5 times a year for work and personal trips, usually staying in Airbnbs because hotels feel sterile and she likes cooking her own meals. Over the past two years, she's had increasingly frustrating experiences with the platform.\n\nLast spring, a host in Portland canceled on her 48 hours before a girls' weekend, forcing her to book a $300/night hotel room. Six months ago in Barcelona, she spent three hours filtering through listings only to find half the \"pet-friendly\" places actually weren't. Most recently, she arrived at a Chicago rental to find it was in a sketchy neighborhood nothing like the photos, with a host who seemed irritated by basic questions about check-in.\n\nMaya's not ready to give up on Airbnb entirely—when it works, it really works. But she's started hedging her bets with backup hotel reservations, which defeats the whole purpose of the platform's pricing advantage.\n\n**How I identified this persona:** I spent about an hour reading through recent App Store reviews and Reddit threads about Airbnb problems. Maya represents the \"experienced but increasingly frustrated\" user segment—people who understand the platform but are hitting repeated pain points that compound over time. She's not a first-time user making rookie mistakes, which makes her feedback more credible for product improvement opportunities."

      "gap": "Airbnb optimizes for inventory volume and booking conversion, but Maya needs confidence and accuracy. The product pushes users toward quick decisions with limited information, then leaves them to manage risk and uncertainty on their own.\n\nThe search experience prioritizes getting listings in front of users over helping them find the right listing. The trust signals are outdated or buried. The pricing is deliberately obscured until checkout. And there's no meaningful protection against the catastrophic failure modes (cancellations, misrepresented properties) that create lasting platform abandonment.",
      "reframe_note": "**First-person framing note:** I initially framed the core job around \"finding unique accommodations\" because that's Airbnb's brand positioning. But digging into Maya's actual behavior, she's not seeking uniqueness—she wants reliability without the hotel premium. The job is fundamentally about risk mitigation in an uncertain marketplace, not discovery of novel experiences. That reframe changes everything about how we should evaluate the product decisions."

Vrbo still uses the hidden fee model like Airbnb. This suggests transparent pricing is feasible but not industry standard—potential differentiation opportunity.\n\n**Host reliability:** Neither competitor has systematic reliability scoring. Vrbo has \"Premier Host\" badges but the criteria aren't transparent. This feels like open territory for Airbnb to lead.\n\n**Amenity verification:** All platforms struggle here. Even hotel booking sites can't guarantee WiFi speed or pool availability in real-time. The guest-verified amenity concept might be genuinely novel, though technically complex.\n\nThe competitive gap suggests these aren't just Airbnb problems—they're vacation rental industry problems. That makes the business case stronger (first-mover advantage) but the execution risk higher (no proven solutions to copy)."
